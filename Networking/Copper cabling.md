# Copper cabling
- Commonly used in LAN's
- Consists of 4 pairs of colored copper embedded in a plastic jack
- Each pair consists of 2 wires **twisted around eachother to avoid signal interferrence** *(The twist "length" is different for each pair)*

## Advantages
- Cheap
- Easy to install
- Good electric conductor

## Disadvantages
- Limited distances
- Signal interference

## Colors
Threads consist of 4 pairs of different colors. Each pair has the primary color and a primary with white stripe.

### Pairs
- **Pair 1**: Blue
- **Pair 2**: Orange
- **Pair 3**: Green
- **Pair 4**: Brown

## Types
- [[Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)]]
- [[Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)]]
- [[Coax Cable]]

## Connector standards
The location of the wires in the RJ-45 connector is important. That why the [[Telecommunication/Electronic Industry Association (TIA/EIA)]] has **2 color standards**.
The difference between the two is that the orange and green pairs are swapped.
- T-568A
- **T-568B** *(most used)*
