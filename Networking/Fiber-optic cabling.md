# Fiber
A cabling type in which data can be transmitted in the form of light signals. This is mainly used for backbones of companies and to pass large distances. *(eg, transatlantic cables)*

## Advantages
- Better for longer distances
- Larger bandwidth
- Immune to EMI and RFI *(interference, which makes it more reliable)*

## Disadvantages
- More expensive
- Harder to install

## Modes
### Single mode (SMF)
Sends 1 straight path for light to travel through.

#### Advantages
- Allows larger distances

#### Disadvantages
- Expensive

### Multi mode (MMF)
Allows multiple paths of light.

#### Advantages
- Cheaper
- Allows multiple paths

## Connectivity
Fiber cables require a **SFP (Small Factor Pluggable)** in order to connect with a switch. This is a hot pluggable network interface module. This allows you to connect any fiber tranceiver to your device/[[Network Interface Card (NIC)]].
