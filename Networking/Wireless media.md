# Wireless
Data gets sent through electromagnetic waves.

- **Unlicensed** spectrum: free for everyone to use
- **Licensed** spectrum: transmission only allowed by paying operators ^5a686b

## Advantages
- Cheap and simple implementation
- More aesthetic *(no cables)*
- Not every location is suitable for cables

## Disadvantages
- Limited transmission speeds
- Higher probability for errors in the transmission *(due to more interference)*
- Signal strength and transmission speed changes depending on the distance from the source
- Signals can easily be intercepted

## Examples
- **WPANs (Wireless Personal Area Networks)**: [[Bluetooth]]
- **Wireless LANs ([[Types of networks#Wireless LAN WLAN|WLAN]]s)**: [[Wi-Fi]]
- **Cellular mobile networks**: [[Cellular#4G|4G]], [[Cellular#5G|5G]]
- **WMANs (Wireless [[Types of networks#Wireless LAN WLAN|WLAN]]s)**: [[WiMAX]]
- **Satellite networks**

## Signaling
**vertical** = Voltage
**horizontal** = Time

- **Modulation**: The adaptation of a characteristic of the carrier wave
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**: Vertical modulation of the signal. *(higher/lower waves)*
- **FM (Frequency Modulation)**: Horizontal modulation of the signal. *(distance between waves shortens/lengthens)*
- **PM (Phase Modulation)**: Vertical inversion of wave oder.
