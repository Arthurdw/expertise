# Network Interface Card (NIC)
- **Ethernet NIC**: Provides access to a wire network
- **WLAN NIC**: Provides access to a wireless network

## Manchester encoding/Phase Encoding
0 -> high to low voltage transition
1 -> low to high voltage transition

## Wireless signaling
**vertical** = Voltage
**horizontal** = Time

- **Modulation**: The adaptation of a characteristic of the carrier wave
- **AM (Amplitude Modulation)**: Vertical modulation of the signal. *(higher/lower waves)*
- **FM (Frequency Modulation)**: Horizontal modulation of the signal. *(distance between waves shortens/lengthens)*
- **PM (Phase Modulation)**: Vertical inversion of wave oder.
