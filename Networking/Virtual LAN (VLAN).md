# Virtual LAN's
- allows networks to be split up without having to have a switch for each network ![[NotLikeThisVlans.png]]![[LikeThisVlans.png]]
## Benefits
- More secure networks *(traffic is limited to own vlan)*
- Better performance *(limits broadcasts)*
- Cost-saving *(only needs to buy one switch)*
- More managable *(changes only need to be applied digitally)*
## Trunks
A point to point connection between 2 network devices, supporting more than one vlan. This allows devices in the same vlan but on a different switch to communicate without going through a router.
