# Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)
- Uses an **RJ-45** connector
## Signal interference
External devices *(like flueorescent lamps and electric motors)* can cause electromagnetic interference and radio frequency interference.

The cables themselves can cause interference too by the electrical of magnetic fields of a signal in an adjacent wire. This is called **crosstalk**

[[Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)]] cables try to prevent this.
